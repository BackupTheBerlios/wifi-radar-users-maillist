Sean, thanks for the feedback.

&gt;<i> &gt; I go through a little scenario below, which shows that in fact I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connect to my home AP successfully with neither a wicd or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wifi-radar installed. I assume it is because in the wlan0 stanza 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in /etc/network/interfaces specifies my AP's ESSID.
</I> 
&gt;<i>   This indicates to me that you have some other WiFi management 
</I>&gt;<i> software running, which may be the source of the WR freeze.  WR is 
</I>&gt;<i> trying to access the WNIC (wireless card) at the same time as this 
</I>&gt;<i> other program and the card contention causes WR and the &quot;iwlist 
</I>&gt;<i> scan&quot; problems.  Do you have NetworkManager running?
</I>
Your answer seems to imply that my supposition was wrong. That is, the 
stanza in the interfaces file specifying the ESSID is not in itself 
sufficient to bring the wireless up. So something is bringing it up. 
You suggest a network manager, but I don't have wifi-radar or wicd or 
network-manager or any other network manager that I know of installed.

I rechecked by rebooting again without ethernet connection, and during 
the boot I was assigned an IP address by my wireless modem's DHCP, and 
once up I could ping www.google.com.

I do a $ ps aux, and find this process:

  dhclient -v -pf /var/run/dhclient.wlan0 pid -lf /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.wlan0.leases wlan0

I get another such process for eth0. I get the impression that 
dhclient does bring the interface up, but not sure. So the question 
is, how is my wireness connection being brought up, and if there is 
contention over the WNIC, how would I know the programs contending for 
it?

&gt;<i> &gt; 1. I start no wicd installed, but with wpasupplicant installed and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a broken wifi-radar. I do in fact under these conditions have a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wifi internet connection.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   I suspect your wifi connection is not due to WR.
</I>
But no wicd, no wifi-radar, no network-manager is installed. Is it 
possible some boot script is running ifup wlan0 automatically?

&gt;<i> &gt; I can do # iwlist scan. In wifi-radar, it seems that closing the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Preference window initiates a periodic scan routine, for my main 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window becomes populated with APs, including my own home AP. All 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have &quot;?&quot; icons because not configured, but all have strenth 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reports. So far so good, but then after a short while, the auto 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scan hangs, the signal strengh icons stop reporing strengh, I get 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a series of &quot;wlan0 Interface doesn't support scanning: Device or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reasource busy&quot; message in the terminal in which I started 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wifi-radar. I also can no longer run # iwlist scan without same 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; error messages in its terminal.
</I> 
&gt;<i>   &quot;wlan0 Interface doesn't support scanning: Device or resource 
</I>&gt;<i> busy&quot; means that iwlist cannot talk to the WNIC and WR calls iwlist 
</I>&gt;<i> for scanning.
</I>
To judge by my little scenario above, when wifi-radar starts and the 
Preferenes window is closed, it calls iwlist. But then when it tries 
to do it again, something else has grabbed the WNIC and iwlist has 
lost access to it. Is that your impression? If so, what is the best 
way to pin down this other program or process?
