I go through a little scenario below, which shows that in fact I 
connect to my home AP successfully with neither a wicd or wifi-radar 
installed. I assume it is because in the wlan0 stanza in 
/etc/network/interfaces specifies my AP's ESSID.

Incidentally, I check if I have internet connection by running firefox 
and googling for a term. Surely there is a simple command line check 
to test if there is internet access. It is simple to ping my modem's 
IP address, but that only shows communication with the modem, not 
beyond it.

&gt;<i> This error comes from a broken configuration file (likely

</I>
Here's the scenario that answers your questions and expans a bit on 
the problem.

1. I start no wicd installed, but with wpasupplicant installed and a 
broken wifi-radar. I do in fact under these conditions have a wifi 
internet connection.

2. In pursuing your suggestion, I discover there exists no 
/etc/wifi-radar/ directory. However, there is a /etc/wifi-radar.conf 
file. This not a pecularity of my distribution, for the wifi-radar man 
page says there should be a wifi-radar directory.

3. I deleted this file and start wifi-radar. As you surmised, a 
configuration file is automatically created when wifi-radar is 
started. But it is again located /etc/wifi-radar.conf.

4. Now a little scenario when I start wifi-radar with a pure new 
configuration file (this is a repeatable scenario). When started, the 
main window is empty, apparently because no scan has taken place yet. 
I can do # iwlist scan. In wifi-radar, it seems that closing the 
Preference window initiates a periodic scan routine, for my main 
window becomes populated with APs, including my own home AP. All have 
&quot;?&quot; icons because not configured, but all have strenth reports. So far 
so good, but then after a short while, the auto scan hangs, the signal 
strengh icons stop reporing strengh, I get a series of &quot;wlan0 
Interface doesn't support scanning: Device or reasource busy&quot; message 
in the terminal in which I started wifi-radar. I also can no longer 
run # iwlist scan without same error messages in its terminal. I 
proceed to select my AP, open and save Configure (without doing 
anything to change configuration), and my AP no longer has a &quot;?&quot;. It 
seems that when wifi-radar initiates a scan, the module scanning 
facility is for some reason already in use, but my ignorance about 
these matters is profound.

5. I close wifi-radar and restart it. The main window now only shows 
my home AP, but wifi-radar can't scan, and so my home AP signal 
strength not displayed. Still can't run # iwlist scan successfully.

6. I purge wifi-radar from my system. But the module still can't do a 
# iwlist scan. Same error messages. So apparently some application 
triggered by wifi-radar grabs the module scan facility. I did not 
purge wpa_supplicant to see if that changed things because I lacked 
the time and see no reason why it would help.

7. I reboot (without having wicp installed, and now also without 
wifi-radar), and when I come up, I automatically have wifi internet 
connection. The # iwlist scan command works.

8. I reinstall wifi-radar. The wifi-radar.conf file again is located
in /etc/ and there's no wifi-radar directory. When I start wifi-radar,
there is a repeat of the little scenario above. Calling Preferences
causes a scan that reports signal strenghs for all APs seen.

9. I try # iwlist scan, but it won't run because device or resource
busy, and that error also being repeatedly reported now in the
wifi-radar terminal. Prior to the periodic error messages there
was info that scrolled out of the terminal window range (perhaps
I should do a trace to capture it), but its last lines were:

	... Autentication Suites (1): PSK
	IE: Unknown: 2A0100

and then a bunch of lines starting with &quot;IE: Unnown:&quot; but followed
by longer hex numbers. 

10. Deleting the conf file and restarting wifi-radar does not help. I 
get some lines that scroll off and then reapeated Device or resource 
busy messages. When I close wifi-radar, this busy messagse are 
followed by:

	Traceback (most recent all last)
	  File /usr/sbin/wifi-radar&quot;,
	    line 935, in destroy self.status_window.destroy()
	  File /usr/sbin/wifi-radar&quot;, 
	    line 2522, in destroy self.dialog.destroy()
	AttributeError: StatusWindow instance has no attribute 'dialog'

I'm ignorance about these things, but this sounds like it is just a
normal shutdown of the window instance.
